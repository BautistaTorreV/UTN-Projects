<h3 align="rigth">Operating System Process Scheduler</h3>
This project focused on the simulation of a process scheduling system, implementing different scheduling policies such as FIFO (First In, First Out), Round-Robin (RR), and Virtual Round-Robin (VRR). The goal was to analyze the efficiency of each strategy under varying workloads, understanding how operating systems manage process execution, context switching, and CPU resource allocation. The assignment also involved simulating memory management, inter-process communication (IPC), and handling system interrupts, reinforcing core principles of operating system design.

<h3 align="rigth">Distributed System for Resource Management</h3>
This project consisted of designing and implementing a distributed system to manage resources for an NGO. The system aimed to facilitate donation tracking, volunteer coordination, and inventory management through a structured API. The assignment required integrating multiple architectural components, including a backend service for data processing, a relational database for persistent storage, and a frontend interface for user interaction. Additionally, the project explored security best practices, API documentation, and cloud deployment strategies to ensure scalability and reliability.

<h3 align="rigth">Functional Programming and Parser Combinators</h3>
This project focused on the development of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to define and manipulate images using functional programming principles. The goal was to design a system that could construct and transform graphical representations by applying parser combinators, allowing the interpretation of textual commands into structured image modifications. The assignment emphasized working with immutability, recursion, and higher-order functions, as well as combining functional and object-oriented approaches for code modularity.

<h3 align="rigth">Metaprogramming & Custom Testing Framework</h3>
This project involved the creation of a custom testing framework using metaprogramming techniques. The objective was to design a tool that could dynamically analyze and execute test cases on different software components. The framework allowed for defining custom assertions, mocking behaviors, and tracking execution logs. A key part of the assignment was leveraging reflection to introspect code structure and dynamically generate test cases, making it easier to extend and integrate with various projects.

<h3 align="rigth">Marketplace Management System</h3>
This project involves the design and implementation of a marketplace management system that facilitates product listings, sales transactions, payments, shipments, and invoice generation. The system is based on SQL Server 2019, requiring data migration and normalization from an unstructured database. The project was divided into two main phases:

1. Transactional Database Model - Development of a structured relational database schema to manage business operations efficiently, ensuring data integrity and normalization.
2. Business Intelligence Model - Implementation of a data warehouse for analytical queries, enabling insights into sales performance, customer demographics, payment trends, and delivery efficiency.

The project also emphasized stored procedures, triggers, and indexing for optimization, ensuring efficient data retrieval and system scalability.
